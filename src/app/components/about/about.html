        <p class="about-text">
          <span class="highlight">Unposted</span> is your personal corner of the internet â€”
          a safe place for the words you've been keeping in drafts, notes, or your heart.  
          Nothing here needs to be perfect or polished â€” it's about
          <em>writing what you feel</em>, <em>sharing what matters</em>,
          and giving your unposted words a home.

          Whether itâ€™s a thought, a poem, a half-written story, or a single sentence
          that carries meaning for you â€” it belongs here.  
          Unposted is about <span class="highlight">expression without pressure</span>.
